# Architecture Improvements Plan

This document outlines the proposed improvements to the Event Parking App's architecture and organization. Each section includes specific tasks and their rationale.

## ⚠️ Outdated ⚠️

## 1. Component Organization

### Current State

✅ Components are already well-organized into domain-specific directories:

- `components/navigation/` - Contains NavigationBar and BackButton
- `components/events/` - Contains EventCard and EventSearch
- `components/parking/` - Contains ParkingSpotCard
- `components/auth/` - Contains ProtectedRoute and SignInPromptModal
- `components/layout/` - Layout components
- `components/background/` - Background components
- `components/location/` - Location-related components

### Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Create `components/common/` directory for shared components
- [ ] Move `DrivewayCard` to `components/parking/` (if it exists)
- [ ] Move `BookingForm` to `components/parking/` (if it exists)
- [ ] Add component documentation in each component directory
- [ ] Create index files for each component category for better imports

### Rationale

- Better organization of components by domain
- Easier to find and maintain related components
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Improved code reusability

## 2. State Management

### Tasks

- [ ] Create `store/` directory at root level
- [ ] Implement Redux Toolkit or Zustand
- [ ] Create `store/slices/` directory with:
  - [ ] `authSlice.ts`
  - [ ] `bookingsSlice.ts`
  - [ ] `eventsSlice.ts`
  - [ ] `drivewaysSlice.ts`
- [ ] Add state persistence layer
- [ ] Create state selectors for common queries
- [ ] Add state debugging tools

### Rationale

- Better handling of complex state
- Improved performance for real-time updates
- Easier debugging and state tracking
- Better separation of concerns

## 3. API Layer

### Tasks

- [ ] Create `api/` directory at root level
- [ ] Move Firebase code to `api/firebase/`
- [ ] Create `api/stripe/` for payment services
- [ ] Add `api/types/` for API interfaces
- [ ] Implement API error handling middleware
- [ ] Add API request/response logging
- [ ] Create API documentation

### Rationale

- Centralized API management
- Better error handling
- Improved type safety
- Easier API maintenance

## 4. Testing Structure

### Tasks

- [ ] Create `__tests__/` directory at root level
- [ ] Add test directories mirroring src structure:
  - [ ] `__tests__/components/`
  - [ ] `__tests__/pages/`
  - [ ] `__tests__/hooks/`
  - [ ] `__tests__/services/`
- [ ] Create `__mocks__/` directory
- [ ] Add `cypress/` for E2E testing
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting
- [ ] Add integration test examples

### Rationale

- Better test organization
- Improved test coverage
- Easier test maintenance
- Better quality assurance

## 5. Constants and Configuration

### Tasks

- [ ] Create `config/` directory at root level
- [ ] Add environment configuration
- [ ] Add Firebase configuration
- [ ] Add API endpoints configuration
- [ ] Add feature flags
- [ ] Add application constants
- [ ] Add configuration validation

### Rationale

- Centralized configuration
- Better environment management
- Easier configuration updates
- Improved security

## 6. Error Handling

### Tasks

- [ ] Create `errors/` directory in `src/`
- [ ] Add custom error classes
- [ ] Create error boundary components
- [ ] Add error handling utilities
- [ ] Implement error logging service
- [ ] Add error reporting to monitoring service

### Rationale

- Better error management
- Improved user experience
- Easier debugging
- Better error tracking

## 7. Types Organization

### Tasks

- [ ] Reorganize `types/` directory:
  - [ ] Add `types/api/`
  - [ ] Add `types/models/`
  - [ ] Add `types/state/`
- [ ] Create type documentation
- [ ] Add type validation
- [ ] Create type utilities

### Rationale

- Better type organization
- Improved type safety
- Easier type maintenance
- Better documentation

## 8. Feature-based Organization

### Tasks

- [ ] Create `features/` directory in `src/`
- [ ] Reorganize into feature modules:
  - [ ] `features/auth/`
  - [ ] `features/events/`
  - [ ] `features/bookings/`
  - [ ] `features/driveways/`
- [ ] Each feature should have:
  - [ ] `components/`
  - [ ] `hooks/`
  - [ ] `services/`
  - [ ] `types/`
- [ ] Add feature documentation

### Rationale

- Better feature isolation
- Improved code organization
- Easier feature maintenance
- Better scalability

## 9. Documentation

### Tasks

- [ ] Create `docs/` directory at root level
- [ ] Add architecture decisions documentation
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Add component documentation
- [ ] Add setup instructions
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines
- [ ] Add deployment documentation

### Rationale

- Better knowledge sharing
- Easier onboarding
- Improved maintainability
- Better collaboration

## 10. Build and Deployment

### Tasks

- [ ] Create `scripts/` directory
- [ ] Add build scripts
- [ ] Add deployment scripts
- [ ] Create `ci/` directory
- [ ] Add CI/CD configuration
- [ ] Add `docker/` directory if needed
- [ ] Add deployment documentation

### Rationale

- Better build process
- Improved deployment
- Easier maintenance
- Better automation

## 11. Performance Optimization

### Tasks

- [ ] Create `src/optimization/` directory
- [ ] Add code splitting configuration
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Add lazy loading utilities
- [ ] Add performance documentation
- [ ] Add optimization guidelines

### Rationale

- Better performance
- Improved user experience
- Easier optimization
- Better monitoring

## 12. Internationalization

### Tasks

- [ ] Create `src/i18n/` directory
- [ ] Add translation files
- [ ] Add language utilities
- [ ] Add language switching
- [ ] Add translation documentation
- [ ] Add language guidelines

### Rationale

- Better internationalization
- Improved user experience
- Easier language maintenance
- Better accessibility

## Implementation Priority

1. Component Organization (High)
2. State Management (High)
3. API Layer (High)
4. Testing Structure (Medium)
5. Constants and Configuration (Medium)
6. Error Handling (Medium)
7. Types Organization (Medium)
8. Feature-based Organization (Low)

## Notes

- Each task should be implemented incrementally
- Tests should be written for all new code
- Documentation should be updated as changes are made
- Code reviews should be conducted for all changes
- Performance should be monitored throughout implementation

## Contributing

When implementing these changes:

1. Create a new branch for each major change
2. Write tests for new code
3. Update documentation
4. Submit a pull request
5. Get code review
6. Merge only after approval
